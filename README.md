# Convex Hull Visualiser

**Convex Hull Visualiser** is a python library used to visualise
the convex hull of 2-dimensional datasets. The library implements
the [QuickHull](https://doi.org/10.1145/355759.355766), a 
divide-and-conquer algorithm first described by William F. 
Eddy in 1997.

## Setup
1. Go to the source directory using `cd src`
2. Install the dependencies  
   Assuming you've installed the latest version of Python 
   (if not, guides for it are widely available),
   1. ensure pip is installed by running `python -m ensurepip --upgrade`
   2. install the library dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. You can now import and use the library as intended.  
   To view a demonstration of the library,
   1. run Jupyter Notebook using `jupyter notebook`
   2. locate and open the source directory in your machine
   3. open `convex_hull.ipynb` and click `Run All`
